Sonata is a simple, yet powerful PHP MVC framework for programmers that are tired of over-complicated web development. Sonata is inspired by the Cocoa/UIKit framework by Apple Inc. So, if you're a Mac/iPhone developer you'll love this framework. However, anyone who's in love with objects and clean, well-structured beautiful code will find Sonata useful.
